# :wave: Hello!

üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My name is Hun Jae (/Hun-JAY/, ÌóåÏû¨) Lee, and I am a software engineer currently residing in Cleveland, Ohio :us:. I am originally from Seoul, Korea :kr:

My three main personal values are:

- Give back to the community. :muscle:
- Collaboration over competition. :dancers:
- Benefit the humankind with my skillset. :earth_asia:

I thrive in an agile development environment in a rapidly-growing startup atmosphere. I enjoy being involved in the whole process of the product development, seeing the "big picture" of the overall product's vision, and making educated & technical decisions accordingly. You can view my resume [here](https://hunj.dev/resume/) if you're interested in my background.

After work, you‚Äôll see me grabbing a fresh cold one :beer:, playing video games with friends :video_game:, and traveling on weekends :car: to eat gourmet food :stew: (but currently staying at home due to the pandemic). I also enjoy taking pictures :camera: of my rescued cat Retsuko. :smirk_cat:
