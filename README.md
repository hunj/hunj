# :wave: Hello!

üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My name is Hun Jae (/Hun-JAY/, ÌóåÏû¨) Lee, and I am a software engineer currently residing in Cleveland, Ohio :us:. I am originally from Seoul, Korea :kr:.

I thrive in an agile development environment in a rapidly-growing startup atmosphere. I enjoy being involved in the whole process of the product development, seeing the "big picture" of the overall product's vision, and making educated & technical decisions accordingly. You can view my resume [here](https://hunj.github.io/resume/) if you're interested in my background.

After work, you‚Äôll see me sippin' on a fresh cold brew :beer: :coffee:, playing/streaming video games with friends :video_game:, and traveling on weekends :car: to eat gourmet food :stew: _(but currently staying at home due to the pandemic)_. I also enjoy taking pictures :camera: of my rescued cat, Retsuko -- please do not aggro the Retsuko! :smirk_cat:

Feel free to reach out to me for networking, exchanges, and collaborations. I'm open to new ideas and fun projects!
