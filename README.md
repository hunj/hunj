# :wave: Hello!

üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My name is Hun Jae (/Hun-JAY/, ÌóåÏû¨) Lee, and I am a software engineer currently residing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania :us:. I am originally from Seoul, Korea :kr: and have lived in Cleveland, Ohio for a long time!

I thrive in agile environment in rapidly-growing startup atmosphere. I enjoy being involved in the whole process of the product development, seeing the "big picture" of the overall product's vision, and making educated & technical decisions accordingly. You can view my resume [here](https://hunj.dev/resume/) if you're interested in my professional background.

After work, you‚Äôll find me sippin' on a fresh cold brew :beer: :coffee: at a hip coffee shop or some new brewery, playing/streaming video games with friends :video_game:, and traveling on weekends :car: to eat gourmet food :stew:. I also enjoy taking pictures :camera: of my friends and my cats.

Feel free to reach out to me for networking, exchanges, and collaborations. I'm open to new ideas and fun projects!
