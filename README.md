# :wave: Hello!

🙋‍♂️ My name is Hun Jae (/Hun-JAY/, 헌재) Lee, and I am a software engineer currently residing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania :us:. I am originally from Seoul, Korea :kr: and have lived in Cleveland, Ohio for a long time!

I have 7+ years of experience in web development, especially with Python and Django (REST framework). I enjoy the art of creating firmly-tested codebase that is readable and self-documenting. You can see my resume on my website here: [hunj.dev/resume](https://hunj.dev/resume)

Feel free to reach out to me for networking, exchanges, and collaborations. I'm open to new ideas and fun projects!
